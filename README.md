This project's goal was to visualize an earthquake dataset using Leaflet, plotting all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers also reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. A legend was also included to indicate the color scheme relating to depth.
